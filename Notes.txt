# npm init

# We keep files on server then upload to 3rd party 
# git not track empty folders so use: .gitkeep
# public/temp/.gitkeep

# .gitignore generator: https://mrkandreev.name/snippets/gitignore-generator/

# .env environment are taken from system not from 

# HotReloading we have problem we whenever make changes we have to start and stop server... so to encouter this problem we use: nodemon
# Nodemon task is to restart the server when ever me save the file after changing
# dev dependency :- only work on dev mode not get to production time

#  npm i -D nodemon 
# script :"dev": "nodemon index.js"

# mkdir controllers db middlewares models routes utils

# for to avoid conflicts during merge use: npm i -D prettier
# .prettierrc :
 {
    "singleQuote": true,
    "bracketSpacing": true,
    "tabWidth": 2,
    "trailingComma": "es5",

Connecting with Mongodb

1. create account-> create cluster -> go to security -> network access -> provide ip address(genrelly this is the ip address of srever machine run) we give 0.0.0.0

2. create user also on same tab of scurity if not created give username passoword(avoid using special characters).

3. connect with cluster it will provide you a string put it in env file add your password in that connection string.

4. now we need to install :- dotenv,express,mongoose

5. Approach 1: index.js directly write using IIFE
   Approach 2:db/db.js and export function to index

6. Advices: use try catch, async await, check your connection string , import may have problem like db ❌  db.js ✅   

#---------------------------------------#
express
1. in app.js we use express 
2. and app.listen will be in index.js using .then() after db connection function runs, its returns promise.

Now app.js work express 

3. documentation read , we mainly learn for request and response

4. Request: req.cookies,req.params

5. installing CORS and COOKIES PArser   (app.use() //middleware)

6. Nowimport both and using cors with app.use(cors({ origin:env.CorsOrigin, }))

7. Some configuration (do with app.use()) : 
   
   > (express.json({limit:"16kb"}))

   > (express.urlencoded(
     {
        extended: true, limit: "16kb"
     }
     )) accept the data from url like what will be ... /abdul samad -> /abdul%samad or /abdul+samad any from will be accepted


   > (express.static("public")) use to store files on own server public assest example favicon

   > (cookiesParser()) help to perform crud operation on cookies

8. we have actually 4 thing (err,req,resp,next) 

9. Standardisation of Error and Response by making class and
