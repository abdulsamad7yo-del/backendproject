# npm init

# We keep files on server then upload to 3rd party 
# git not track empty folders so use: .gitkeep
# public/temp/.gitkeep

# .gitignore generator: https://mrkandreev.name/snippets/gitignore-generator/

# .env environment are taken from system not from 

# HotReloading we have problem we whenever make changes we have to start and stop server... so to encouter this problem we use: nodemon
# Nodemon task is to restart the server when ever me save the file after changing
# dev dependency :- only work on dev mode not get to production time

#  npm i -D nodemon 
# script :"dev": "nodemon index.js"

# mkdir controllers db middlewares models routes utils

# for to avoid conflicts during merge use: npm i -D prettier
# .prettierrc :
 {
    "singleQuote": true,
    "bracketSpacing": true,
    "tabWidth": 2,
    "trailingComma": "es5",
    "semi": true

Connecting with Mongodb

1. create account-> create cluster -> go to security -> network access -> provide ip address(genrelly this is the ip address of srever machine run) we give 0.0.0.0

2. create user also on same tab of scurity if not created give username passoword(avoid using special characters).

3. connect with cluster it will provide you a string put it in env file add your password in that connection string.

4. now we need to install :- dotenv,express,mongoose

5. Approach 1: index.js directly write
   Approach 2:db/db.js and export function to index
